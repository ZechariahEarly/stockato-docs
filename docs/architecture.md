# 2. Development Architecture

This document outlines a comprehensive, layered architecture designed for scalability, security, and ease of integration for the Stockato mobile app.

---

## 1. Mobile Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Environment:**  

- **Expo with React Native:** Leverage Expo for streamlined cross-platform development on Android and iOS.

**Core Components:**  

- **User Interface (UI):**
    - Screens for dashboards, portfolio overviews, news feeds, market insights, and account settings.
    - Emphasis on a clean, intuitive design to simplify complex financial data.
- **Navigation & State Management:**
    - Use libraries such as React Navigation for routing.
    - Manage global state with Redux or React Context for user sessions and subscription status.
- **API Integration:**
    - Secure HTTPS calls to interact with backend REST or GraphQL APIs for authentication, data retrieval, and transactions.
    - Implement robust error handling, loading states, and offline capabilities where needed.

**Security & Analytics:**  

- **Authentication:**  
    - Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) via secure login flows, potentially integrated with AWS Cognito.
- **Analytics:**  
    - Integrate Firebase Analytics or AWS Pinpoint to track user behavior and app performance.

## 2. Backend Architecture (Python-Based)

**Framework & Design:**  

- **Python API Framework:**  
    - Options include FastAPI, Flask, or Django REST Framework.
    - Begin with a modular monolith for an MVP; evolve towards microservices as the user base scales.

**Core Modules & Endpoints:**  

- **Authentication & User Management:**
    - Secure endpoints for sign-up, login, and account management.
    - Issue and validate JWT tokens for authenticated sessions.
- **Data Aggregation & Integration:**
    - **Investment Data:** Integrate with third-party APIs (e.g., Plaid) to retrieve investment account data.
    - **News & Market Data:** Aggregate and curate content from financial news APIs.
- **Machine Learning (ML) Module:**
    - Expose endpoints for personalized recommendations and insights.
    - Use asynchronous processing (via task queues) for heavy computation.
- **Subscription & Payment Processing:**
    - Integrate with payment gateways via the website to manage subscriptions and billing.

**Security Practices:**  

  - Use HTTPS for all communications.
  - Enforce rate limiting, logging, and robust error monitoring.
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

## 3. Cloud Infrastructure on AWS

**Compute & Hosting:**  

- **Containerization & Compute:**  
    - Deploy backend services using AWS Fargate/ECS or AWS Lambda via API Gateway.
- **API Gateway:**  
    - Use AWS API Gateway to manage secure endpoint exposure and traffic routing.

**Data Storage & Management:**  

- **Databases:**  
    - Amazon RDS (e.g., PostgreSQL) for transactional data.
    - DynamoDB for high-performance operations when needed.
- **Static Assets & Caching:**  
    - Store static content in Amazon S3.
    - Use AWS ElastiCache (Redis) for caching sessions and frequently accessed data.

**User Management & Security:**  

- **Authentication:**  
    - Utilize AWS Cognito or a custom authentication system for managing user access.
- **Network Security:**  
    - Employ VPCs, IAM roles, and security groups.
    - Integrate AWS WAF with API Gateway for enhanced protection.

**Monitoring & Logging:**  

- **Operational Insights:**  
    - Leverage CloudWatch for logs, metrics, and alarms.
    - Utilize AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing across services.

## 4. Machine Learning & Data Insights

**ML Service Architecture:**  

- **Model Training & Inference:**  
    - Use AWS SageMaker or a containerized Python service for model training and deployment.
    - Deploy ML inference endpoints for personalized recommendations.
  
**Data Pipeline:**  

- **Data Collection:**  
    - Aggregate user interactions, investment data, and market news into a secure data lake.
- **Batch Processing & Real-Time Analytics:**  
    - Use AWS Lambda or AWS Glue for ETL processes, ensuring ML models are updated with fresh data.

---

## 5. Integration & Communication

**Investment Accounts Integration:**  

- **Secure API Connections:**  
    - Use OAuth or token-based authentication for third-party financial services.
    - Implement asynchronous messaging (e.g., AWS SQS) to handle data synchronization tasks.

**News & Market Data Feeds:**  

- **Content Curation:**  
    - Regularly pull and process data from various financial news APIs.
    - Store curated news items for fast retrieval via the backend.

---

## 6. Deployment, CI/CD & Scalability

**Continuous Integration & Deployment:**  

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
    - Utilize GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, or similar tools to automate testing, building, and deployment.
    - Separate staging and production environments with blue-green or canary deployments.

**Scalability & Resilience:**  

- **Stateless Service Design:**  
    - Build services as stateless to enable auto-scaling using AWS Auto Scaling Groups.
- **Caching & Load Balancing:**  
    - Integrate load balancers (ALB/ELB) and caching layers to efficiently handle peak loads.

---

## 7. Security & Compliance Considerations

**Data Protection:**  

- **Encryption:**  
    - Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (using AWS KMS).
- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
    - Adhere to relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) with regular audits.

**Risk Management:**  

- **Monitoring & Alerts:**  
    - Establish comprehensive monitoring using CloudWatch and automated alerts for any suspicious activity.
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
    - Implement regular backups and a disaster recovery plan for critical data.
